# Bachelor and Master Thesis Topics
Ideas for Bachelor or Master Thesis Topics. As these are only rough ideas, the exact topic can also be discussed and may be adjusted for a smaller or bigger scope. You are also free to suggest your own ideas, especially topics in context to these domains:
- User Interface that are adapting themselves (automatically) to user specific traits/needs/preferences
- Multimodal Systems, especially Speech Assistants
- Augmented Reality
- Technology for Healthcare or Learning
- LLMs in Low-Resource Settings
